# MouseAccuracyGameProject
This was my first individual project. I attempted to make simple version of the game "osu!".

I was able to make a usable interface, implement score tracking , a scoreboard that was loaded from a file, sorting of scores in the leaderboard, and I was also able to
implement the main feature of the game: Circles randomly appear on screen while the timer has not run out. The player can try to click on them as fast as possible to get a
high score. If a player misses a circle (clicks on the background), their score is decreased and their accuracy percentage decreases. I stopepd working on this game after
I got too busy and because I believe JavaFX is not the right framework to build such a game with.

In the future, I would use a different language or not JavaFX and make my code much more readable.
